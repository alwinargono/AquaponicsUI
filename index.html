    <b>Mission</b>
    </p>
    <p class="between">
        Our Mission is to create an aquaponics system that is self-sustainable without any human interactions or require the least minimum 
        amount of human interactions. The exhibit demonstrates the use of IoT and how fish and plants can be cultivated efficiently with 
        minimal waste,space, chemicals, and maintenance costs. Additionally, the system will utilize data collecting and cloud computing to 
        efficiently present data to museum visitors and staff. Finally, the exhibit will feature an attractive and interactive space 
        for children to learn more about aquaponics. The expected outcomes are a more informed agricultural audience, a healthier 
        environment, and food for the community.

    <b>What is Aquaponics?</b>
    </p>
    <p class="between">
      The most simple definition of Aquaponics is the combination of aquaculture (raising fish) and hydroponics (the soil-less growing of 
      plants) that grows fish and plants together in one integrated system. The fish waste provides an organic food source for the plants, 
      and the plants naturally filter the water for the fish. The third participants are microbes (nitrifying bacteria). These bacteria 
      convert ammonia from the fish waste first into nitrites, and then into nitrates.  Nitrates are the form of nitrogen that plants can 
      uptake and use to grow.  Solid fish waste is turned into vermicompost that also acts as food for the plants. In combining both 
      hydroponic and aquaculture systems, aquaponics capitalizes on their benefits, and eliminates the drawbacks of each.</p>

    <b>Design Process</b>
    </p>
    <img class="homepageimg" align="center" src="./image/systemflow.png">
    <p class="between">
        An aquaponics system is a symbiotic system that combines plants and fish as seen in Figure 1. Water is supplied from the fish 
        tank to the plant bed through the use of a pump. Fish excrement is then broken down and converted to organic fertilizers for 
        the plants by worms and other microbes in the plant bed. The excess water used for the plant bed will then be purified by 
        the plants and returned to the fish tank. Aquaponics can save up to 95% more water than traditional agriculture methods and 
        has a shorter turnaround time for vegetable and fish production.
